            What is RenOS?
        </h3>
        <p>
            RenOS is a Linux distribution based on <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> that
            favors simplicity
            over complexity. RenOS uses a desktop enviroment called <a href="https://gnome.org">GNOME</a> that makes
            computing simple again.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why base RenOS on Arch Linux?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Arch Linux (and by extension RenOS) is a rolling release distribution which means that updates to vital
            parts of
            the operating system such as GNOME are available to users much quicker compared to something like <a
                href="https://debian.org">Debian</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Some software I need is not installed by default on RenOS, how do I download it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            RenOS comes with some abolutely needed software by default. When you start RenOS for the first time, a
            window will pop up that will look something like this:
            <br>
            <img src="Setup.png">
            <br>
            This will allow you to install extra software that's not included by default. If something that you want to
            install is not in the setup utility, then feel free to request its addition in the RenOS github repository.
            <br>
            If your application is not included in the setup utility, you can install it using <a
                href="https://apps.gnome.org/Software/">GNOME Software</a>.
            If the application is not bundled as a flatpak (which is the packaging format that's setup on RenOS by
            default)
            then it might be found in the <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/">Arch Linux package repository</a>.
            <br>
            Such packages can be installed via the pacman package manager, a guide on how to use pacman is on the <a
                href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman">Arch Linux Website</a>

            Installation guide
        </h1>
        <h3>Partitioning your disks</h3>
        <p>
            When you first boot from the flash drive an installer window pops up that looks something
            like this:
            <br>
            <img src="screenshots/1.png" width="1000" height="500">
            <br>
            Press "Yes" if you haven't setup your partitions before.
            <br>
            When you press "Yes" a window will soon pop up that looks something like this:
            <img src="screenshots/2.png">
            <br>
            This is the partition editor <a href="https://gparted.org">GPARTED</a>. It allows you to make
            partitions(essentially parts of your disks) that are necessary for RenOS to run.
            <br>
            In the top right of the GPARTED window there's a dropdown selection that allows you pick the disk that you
            want to partition. It'll look something like this:
            <br>
            <img src="screenshots/3.png">
            <br>
            There are multiple types of /dev partitions, /dev/nvme0n1 is an nvme drive, while /dev/sda is the usb that
            the live installation of RenOS is booted from.
            <br>
            This can vary based on hardware, but the general rule of thumb is to identify the disks based on size.
            <br>
            Select the disk that you want to install RenOS on. Create a new partition by clicking the little document
            icon with
            a blue plus on it.
            <img src="screenshots/new.png">
            <br>
            Okay, now we need to create a few partitions. We start by creating the partition that the operating system
            is going to live on.
            <br>
            This will probably be the biggest partition on your disk. It should be formatted with the file system <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4">ext4</a>. The partition create dialog(when you're done with
            the partitioning) should look something like this:
            <br>
            <img src="screenshots/4.png">
            <br>
            Let's now create the swap partition. Swap is basically a partition that gets used when your RAM is full to
            prevent the system from crashing. This partition should be about eight gigabytes.
            <br>
            <img src="screenshots/5.png">
            <br>
            Final partition to create is the boot partition. Here's where all the files that the computer needs to be
            able to start any operating system lives.
            It should be about one gigabyte in size.
            <br>
            <img src="screenshots/6.png">
            <br>
            Now press the green checkmark to apply your changes.
            <br>
            <img src="screenshots/apply.png">
            <br>

            Now that the partitions have been created, return back to the installer window and select your partitions.
            <br>

        <br>
        After that, pick your locale. This can be a bit confusing. The locales are described in <a
            href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Locale">this</a> article. Some example locales are:
        <br>
        en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
        <br>
        en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8
        <br>
        sv_SE.UTF-8 UTF-8
        <br>
        UTF-8 is the most common type of locale, ISO locales are generally not used anymore.

            Restoring RenOS from a broken state
        </h1>
        If something's gone wrong with your RenOS installation, then it might be wise to use this feature.
        What RenOS restore MAY fix:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Your computer UEFI/BIOS tells you that there are no boot devices available (RenOS doesn't start)
            </li>
            <li>
                An update has not been successfully completed and some essential package is corrupt
            </li>
        </ul>
        What RenOS restore probably WON'T fix:
        <ul>
            <li>
                You've uninstalled an important part of your system such as GNOME
            </li>
        </ul>
